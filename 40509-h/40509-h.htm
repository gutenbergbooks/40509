<h2>LORD ORMONT&#39;S MATE AND MATEY&#39;S AMINTA.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By G***GE M*R*D*TH.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Volume I.</span></p>

<p class="indent">This was a school. Small wonder if the boys, doubly sensitive
under a supercilious head-master of laughter-moving invention,
poised for a moment on the to and fro of a needless knockabout jig-face
with chin and mouth all a-pucker for
the inquisitive contest. The stout are
candid puff-balls blowing in an open sea
of purposeless panting, hard to stir into
an elephantine surging from arm-chairs;
and these are for frock-coats, and they
can wear watch-chains. So these boys
understood it. <span class="smcap">Murat</span> here, <span class="smcap">Murat</span> there,
<span class="smcap">Murat</span> everywhere, with <span class="smcap">Shalders</span>
a-burst at the small end of a trumpet,
cheeks rounded to the full note of an
usher&#39;s eulogy, like a roar and no mistake,
arduous in the moment, throbbing
beneath a schoolmaster&#39;s threadbare waistcoat,
a heart all dandelions to the plucker,
yellow on top with white shifts for feather-fringe;
or a daisy, transferring petulance
on a bath-chair wheezing and groaning&mdash;on
the swing for the capture of a fare&mdash;or
shall it be a fair, that too a wheeze permitted
to propriety hoist on a flaxy,
grinning chub. This was <span class="smcap">Shalders</span>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:30%;">
<a href="images/037.png"><img width="100%" src="images/037.png" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p class="indent">Lady <span class="smcap">Charlotte Eglett</span> appeared.
Hers was the brother, the Lord <span class="smcap">Ormont</span>
we know, a general of cavalry not a
doubt, all sabretache, spurs and plumes,
dashing away into a Hindoo desert like
the soldier he is, a born man sword in fist.
She wrote, &quot;Come to me. He is said to
be married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke to her. &quot;My father was a
soldier.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He too?&quot; she interposed.</p>

<p class="indent">Their eyes clashed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are the tutor for me,&quot; she added.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For your grandson,&quot; corrected he.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a bargain. They struck it. She glanced right and left,
showing the town-bred tutor her hedges at the canter along the
main road of her scheme.</p>

<p class="indent">His admiration of the cavalry-brother rose to a fever-point. Not
good with the pen, Lady <span class="smcap">Charlotte</span> opined; hard to beat at a
sword-thrust, thought <span class="smcap">Matey</span>. &quot;Be his pen-holder,&quot; put in the
lady. &quot;I <i>would</i>,&quot; said he, smiling again. She split sides, convulsed
in a take-offish murmur, a roll
here, a roll there, rib-tickling with eyes
goggling on the forefront of a sentence
all rags, tags, and splutters like a jerry-builder
gaping at a waste land pegged out
in plots, foundations on the dig, and auctioneer
prowling hither thither, hammer
ready for the &quot;gone&quot; which shall spin a
nobody&#39;s land into a somebody&#39;s money
passing over counter or otherwise pocket to
pocket, full to empty or almost empty, with
a mowling choke-spark of a batter-foot all
quills for the bean-feast. So they understood
it.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Matey</span> then was Lord <span class="smcap">Ormont&#39;s</span> secretary.
A sad dog his Lordship; all the
women on bended knees to his glory. Who
shall own him? What cares he so it be a
petticoat? For women go the helter-skelter
pace; head-first they plunge or kick like
barking cuckoos. You can tether them with
a dab for Sir <span class="smcap">Francis Jeune</span>. He will
charge a jury to the right-about of a
crapulous fallow-ball, stiff as Rhadamanthus
eyeing the tremblers. But <span class="smcap">Matey</span>
had met this one before. Memories came
pouring. He gazed. Was she, in truth,
Lord <span class="smcap">Ormont&#39;s</span>? The thought spanked
him in the face. A wife? Possibly. And
with an aunt&mdash;<span class="smcap">Aminta&#39;s</span> aunt. She has a
nose like a trout skimming a river for
flies, then rises a minute and you not
there, always too late with rod and line
for sport. But there was danger to
these two, and Lord <span class="smcap">Ormont</span> was writing his Memoirs. A mad
splashing of unnecessary ink on the foolscap made for his head,
never more to wear the plumed cocked hat in a clash of thunder-bearing
squadrons.</p>

<h2>A VADE MECUM FOR THE NAVAL
MAN&OElig;UVRES.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Compiled by a Pessimist.</i>)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Question.</i> Will the Naval Man&oelig;uvres of
1894 have any novel features?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Answer.</i> Only in the imagination of the
special correspondents.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Will there be the customary coloured
fleets?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Yes, with the usual commanders,
officers and men.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Will the lesson that a fleet having speed
equal to a pursuing fleet, if given a start, will
escape, be taught to all concerned?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Yes, to the great admiration of the
authorities at Somerset House and Whitehall.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Will it be demonstrated that if a town
on the coast is left undefended, a hostile ironclad
will be able to bombard it at pleasure?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Yes, to the satisfaction of every scientist
in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Will it also be made clear to the
meanest comprehension that if the night is
sufficiently dark, and search-lights insufficient,
a fleet will get out of a harbour in spite
of considerable opposition?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Yes, to the great appreciation of the
world at large, and the British public in particular.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> Will there be the customary secrecy
about self-evident facts and trivial details?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> Yes, to the annoyance of the newspaper
correspondents, and the indignation of
editors thirsting for copy.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Q.</i> And, lastly, how may the Naval Man&oelig;uvres
be appropriately defined?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> As the means of obtaining the minimum
of information at the maximum of expense.</p>

Does he guess who <i>I</i> am? Somehow&mdash;&mdash;Well, he certainly <i>is</i>
different from what I expected. I thought he would show more
signs of having thought and suffered; for he <i>must</i> have suffered to
write as he does. If Mamma knew I had read his poems; that I had
actually written to beg him not to refuse Aunt <span class="smcap">Albinia&#39;s</span> invitation!
He never wrote back. Of course I didn&#39;t put my address; but still,
he could have found out from the Red Book if he&#39;d cared. I&#39;m
rather glad now he <i>didn&#39;t</i> care.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> Old girl seems as if she meant to be sociable;

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> Broke the ice, anyway. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Oh, <i>I</i> don&#39;t
want it down, but some people are fond of fresh air.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant. (with a dignified little shiver).</i> With a temperature as
glacial as it is in here! Surely not!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr.</i> Well, it <i>is</i> chilly; been raw all day. (<i>To himself.</i>) She

How odd of him to read the <i>Globe</i>! I thought he was a Democrat!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> <span class="smcap">Maisie</span>, there&#39;s quite a clever little notice in <i>Society
Snippets</i> about the dance at <span class="smcap">Skympings</span> last week. I&#39;m sure I
wonder how they pick up these things; it quite bears out what I
was told; says the supper arrangements were &quot;simply disgraceful;
<i>no</i> plovers&#39; eggs, and not nearly enough champagne; and what
there was, undrinkable!&quot; So <i>like</i> poor dear Lady <span class="smcap">Chesepare</span>;
never <i>does</i> do things like anybody else. I&#39;m sure <i>I&#39;ve</i> given her
hints enough!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr. (to himself, with a suppressed grin).</i> Wants to let me see
<i>she</i> knows some swells. Now <i>ain&#39;t</i> that paltry?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant. (tendering the paper).</i> Would you like to see it,
<span class="smcap">Maisie?</span> Just this hit here; where my finger is.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Maisie (to herself, flushing).</i> I saw him smile. What <i>must</i>
he think of us, with his splendid scorn for rank? (<i>Aloud.</i>) No,
thank you, Mamma; such a wretched light to read by!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> Chance for <i>me</i> to cut in! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Beastly
light, isn&#39;t it? &#39;Pon my word, the company ought to provide us
with a dog and string apiece when we get out!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant. (bringing a pair of long-handled glasses to bear upon
him).</i> I happen to hold shares in this line. May I ask <i>why</i> you
consider a provision of dogs and string at all the stations a necessary
or desirable expenditure?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page041" id="page041"></a>[pg&nbsp;041]</span>
<i>Spurr.</i> Oh&mdash;er&mdash;well, you know, I only meant, bring on <i>blindness</i>
and that. Harmless attempt at a joke, that&#39;s all.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> I see. I scarcely expected that <i>you</i> would condescend
to such weakness. I&mdash;ah&mdash;think you are going down to stay at
Wyvern for a few days, are you not?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr (to himself).</i> I was right. What <span class="smcap">Tom</span> said <i>did</i> fetch the
old girl; no harm in humouring her a bit. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Yes&mdash;oh yes,
they&mdash;aw&mdash;wanted me to run down when I could.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> I heard they were expecting you. You will find
Wyvern a pleasant house&mdash;for a short visit.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr (to himself). She</i> heard! Oh, she wants to kid me she
knows the <span class="smcap">Culverins</span>. Rats! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Shall I, though? I daresay.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span> is a very sweet woman; a little
limited, perhaps, not intellectual, or quite what one would call the
<i>grande dame</i>; but perhaps <i>that</i> could scarcely be expected.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr. (vaguely).</i> Oh, of course not&mdash;no. (<i>To himself.</i>) If she
bluffs, so can I! (<i>Aloud.</i>) It&#39;s funny your turning out to be an
acquaintance of Lady C.&#39;s, though.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> You think so? But I should hardly call myself an
<i>acquaintance</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> Old cat&#39;s trying to back out of it now; she
<i>shan&#39;t</i>, though! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Oh, then I suppose you know Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>
best?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> Yes, I certainly know Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> better.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr. (to himself).</i> Oh, you do, do you? We&#39;ll see. (<i>Aloud.</i>)
Nice cheery old chap, Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert</span>, isn&#39;t he? I must tell him I
travelled down in the same carriage with a particular friend of his.
(<i>To himself.</i>) That&#39;ll make her sit up!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant.</i> Oh, then you and my brother <span class="smcap">Rupert</span> have met already?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr. (aghast).</i> Your brother! Sir <span class="smcap">Rupert Culverin</span> your&mdash;&mdash;!
Excuse me&mdash;if I&#39;d only known, I&mdash;I do assure you I never should
have dreamt of saying&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lady Cant. (graciously).</i> You&#39;ve said nothing whatever to distress
yourself about. You couldn&#39;t possibly be expected to know
who I was. Perhaps I had better tell you at once that I am Lady
<span class="smcap">Cantire</span>, and this is my daughter, Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie Mull</span>. (<span class="smcap">Spurrell</span>
<i>returns</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Maisie&#39;s</span> <i>little bow in the deepest confusion.</i>) We are
going down to Wyvern too, so I hope we shall very soon become
better acquainted.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Spurr. (to himself, overwhelmed).</i> The deuce we shall! I <i>have</i>
got myself into a hole this time; I wish I could see my way well out
of it! Why on earth couldn&#39;t I hold my confounded tongue? I
<i>shall</i> look an ass when I tell &#39;em.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Scene V.</span>&mdash;<i>A Second-Class Compartment.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Undershell (to himself).</i> Singularly attractive face this girl has;
so piquant and so refined! I can&#39;t help fancying she is studying me
under her eyelashes. She has remarkably bright eyes. Can she
be interested in me? does she expect me to talk to her? There are
only she and I&mdash;but no, just now I would rather be alone with my
thoughts. This <span class="smcap">Maisie Mull</span> whom I shall meet so soon; what
is <i>she</i> like, I wonder? I presume she is unmarried. If I may judge
from her artless little letter, she is young and enthusiastic, and she
is a passionate admirer of my verse; she is longing to meet me. I
suppose some men&#39;s vanity would be flattered by a tribute like that.
I think I must have none; for it leaves me strangely cold. I did not
even reply; it struck me that it would be difficult to do so with any
dignity, and she didn&#39;t tell me where to write to.... After all,
how do I know that this will not end&mdash;like everything else&mdash;in disillusion?
Will not such crude girlish adoration pall upon me in
time? If she were exceptionally lovely; or say, even as charming
as this fair fellow-passenger of mine&mdash;why then, to be sure&mdash;but no,
something warns me that that is not to be. I shall find her plain,
sandy, freckled; she will render me ridiculous by her undiscriminating
gush.... Yes, I feel my heart sink more and more at the
prospect of this visit. Ah me!</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">
[<i>He sighs heavily.</i></p>

<p class="indent"><i>His Fellow Passenger (to herself).</i> It&#39;s too silly to be sitting here
like a pair of images, considering that&mdash;&mdash;(<i>Aloud.</i>) I hope you
aren&#39;t feeling unwell?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> Thank you, no, not unwell. I was merely thinking.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>His Fellow P.</i> You don&#39;t seem very cheerful over it, I must say.
I&#39;ve no wish to be inquisitive, but perhaps you&#39;re feeling a little
lowspirited about the place you&#39;re going to?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und.</i> I&mdash;I must confess I am rather dreading the prospect. How
wonderful that you should have guessed it!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>His Fellow P.</i> Oh, I&#39;ve been through it myself. I&#39;m just the
same when <i>I</i> go down to a new place; feel a sort of sinking, you
know, as if the people were sure to be disagreeable, and I should never
get on with them.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und. Exactly</i> my own sensations! If I could only be sure of
finding <i>one</i> kindred spirit, one soul who would help and understand
me. But I daren&#39;t let myself hope even for that!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>His Fellow P.</i> Well, I wouldn&#39;t judge beforehand. The chances
are there&#39;ll be <i>somebody</i> you can take to.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und. (to himself).</i> What sympathy! What bright, cheerful
common sense! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Do you know, you encourage me more
than you can possibly imagine!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>His Fellow P. (retreating).</i> Oh, if you are going to take my remarks
like <i>that</i>, I shall be afraid to go on talking to you!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und. (with pathos).</i> Don&#39;t&mdash;<i>don&#39;t</i> be afraid to talk to me! If you
only knew the comfort you give! I have found life very sad, very
solitary. And true sympathy is so rare, so refreshing. I&mdash;I fear
such an appeal from a stranger may seem a little startling; it is
true that hitherto we have only exchanged a very few sentences;
and yet already I feel that we have something&mdash;much&mdash;in common.
You can&#39;t be so cruel as to let all intimacy cease here&mdash;it is quite
tantalising enough that it must end so soon. A very few more
minutes, and this brief episode will be only a memory; I shall have
left the little green oasis far behind me, and be facing the dreary
desert once more&mdash;alone!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>His Fellow P. (laughing).</i> Well, of all the uncomplimentary
things! As it happens, though, &quot;the little green oasis&quot;&mdash;as you&#39;re
kind enough to call me&mdash;<i>won&#39;t</i> be left behind; not if it&#39;s aware of
it! I think I heard your friend mention Wyvern Court! Well,
that&#39;s where <i>I</i>&#39;m going.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>His Fellow P.</i> What were you going to say; <i>what</i> must I be?</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Und. (to himself).</i> There is no doubt about it; bright, independent
girl; gloves a trifle worn; travels second-class for economy;
it must be Miss <span class="smcap">Mull</span> herself; her letter mentioned Lady <span class="smcap">Culverin</span>
as her aunt. A poor relation, probably. She doesn&#39;t suspect that
I am&mdash;&mdash;I won&#39;t reveal myself just yet; better let it dawn upon her
gradually. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Why, I was only about to say, why then you
must be going to the same house as I am. How extremely fortunate
a coincidence!</p>

<p class="indent"><i>His Fellow P.</i> We shall see. (<i>To herself.</i>) What a funny little
man; such a flowery way of talking for a footman. Oh, but I forgot;

<h2>FOR ARMS OR ALMS?</h2>

<p class="indent">An advertisement appears in a recent number of the <i>Athenæum</i>,
headed &quot;Devon Volunteer Commemoration,&quot; in which &quot;Drawings
are invited for a memorial of the fact that the Volunteer Movement
of 1852 originated in Devonshire.&quot; According to the regulations,
&quot;Drawings must be accompanied by tenders for carrying out the
work.&quot; Moreover, &quot;the total cost, including all charges for designing,
carrying out, superintending, and erecting the work, and surrounding
the same with a suitable iron railing, must not exceed
£200.&quot; Now this is really a very fair sum, and to assist one of our
readers to win the prize, we allot the money in appropriate items.
Of course we can only give a rough estimate, but it should be near
enough to suit its purpose.</p>

<h2>OPERA NOTES.</h2>

<p class="indent"><i>Tuesday, July 17.</i>&mdash;&quot;The opera season will terminate July 30.&quot;
To-night <span class="smcap">Verdi&#39;s</span> opera of <i>Aïda</i>, &quot;with the dotlets on the <i>i</i>.&quot; First
appearance of Madame <span class="smcap">Adini</span>, a spacious <i>prima donna</i> who amply
fills the part. <span class="smcap">Giulia Ravogli</span> an excellent <i>Amneris</i>. Opera
apparently not particularly attractive, or more powerful attractions
elsewhere.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Saturday, 21.</i>&mdash;<i>Pagliacci</i> followed by new opera entitled <i>The
Lady of Longford</i>, though it would have been more polite had the
Pagliacci allowed the Lady to precede them. But Pagliacci will be
Pagliacci. <i>The Lady</i>&#39;s Librettists are Sir <span class="smcap">Druriolanus Poeticus</span>
and Mr. <span class="smcap">F. E. Weatherly</span>. The music is by <span class="smcap">Emil Bach</span>. The
Gentlemen of Longford are represented by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Alvarez</span> and
<span class="smcap">Edouard de Reszke</span>, while <i>the</i> Lady, the big lady, is <span class="smcap">Emma Eames</span>&mdash;&quot;quite
the lady&quot;&mdash;and the little lady is <span class="smcap">Evelyn Hughes</span>. This
new Lady turns out to be our old friend the one-act drama by
<span class="smcap">Tom Taylor</span> entitled <i>A Sheep in Wolf&#39;s Clothing</i>, set to music, the
comic characters being omitted, and the end made tragic instead of
happy. The music does not entitle <span class="smcap">Bach</span> to take a front seat.
<span class="smcap">Emma Eames</span> excellent; <span class="smcap">Fanny Hughes</span> funny; <span class="smcap">Alvarez</span> good;
<span class="smcap">Jean de Reszke</span> first-rate all-round-head Colonel, but more like a
Cathedral than a Kirk. Composer and Librettists complimented;

&quot;after putting £300,000 into the building without receiving a farthing

but in such circumstances as one would not have expected from a
nobleman in the Duke of <span class="smcap">Bedford&#39;s</span> position.&quot; Ahem! Why did
not Sir <span class="smcap">Druriolanus</span> arise and, remembering the <i>Barber of Seville</i>,
sing &quot;<span class="smcap">Chitty, Chitty</span>, <i>piano! piano!</i>&quot; But naturally the Drury

<h2>THE &quot;GRAND NATIONAL&quot;
TRUST.</h2>

<p class="indent">A Meeting has recently
taken place at Grosvenor
House to establish a National
Trust, the idea being to preserve
places of historic interest
and natural beauty.
Announced at the meeting
that already a beautiful cliff
had been promised by a lady.
We understand the following
promises have also been received:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Duke of W-stm-nst-r.</i>&mdash;A
very handsome
ground-rent. Intended to
support and sustain beautiful
cliffs, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The Duke of D-v-nsh-re.</i>&mdash;Ch-tsw-rth,
which, owing
to recent legislation, he can
no longer afford to keep up.
Intends to take a small cottage,
it is believed, at some
inexpensive town on the
East Coast. Several Distressed
Dukes have also promised,
on their death, to
leave their estates to the
Trust.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A Lover of Ozone.</i>&mdash;A
particularly bracing breeze.
To be dedicated to the public
for ever.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>The London County Council.</i>&mdash;The
Shaftesbury Fountain.
The L. C. C., we
understand, welcomes the
prospect of handing over to
the Trust the responsibility
attaching to this insoluble
problem.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A Hertfordshire Gentleman.</i>&mdash;A
thoroughly reliable
right of way.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Th-m-s B-ch-m.</i>&mdash;A
unique collection of signboards
<i>in situ</i>. These are
placed in the midst of the
most lovely natural scenery,
and in themselves will very
soon, it is hoped, be of <i>historic</i>
interest.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sir Fr-d-r-ck P-ll-ck</i> will
arrange in every case to
supply a good title.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Mr. Punch</i> heartily commends
so patriotic a scheme
to his readers. Any beautiful
cliffs, ground-rents, rights
of way, &amp;c., sent to him at
85, Fleet Street will immediately
be forwarded to the
proper quarter. N.B.&mdash;It is
just possible an exception to
this rule might be made in
the case of ground-rents.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center">EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>House of Commons, Monday, July 16.</i>&mdash;The Blameless B. is
translated into the Breathless <span class="smcap">Bartley</span>. Of eleven pages of Amendments
to Budget Bill standing for consideration when House met
to-day, not less than three contributed by this particular B.
Embodied readjusted scale of graduated taxation. Only objections
to it presently stated by <span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span>: (1) It would
necessitate total reconstruction of Bill (2) resulting in loss of
£643,000; (3) whole question had been thoroughly threshed out in
Committee. To raise it again at eleventh hour seemed too much to
ask even in connection with Budget Bill.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless <span class="smcap">Bartley</span>, not yet breathless, moved his multitudinous
Amendment. Resumed his seat with consciousness of man
who had done his duty. The <span class="smcap">Squire</span> would get up to answer him;
debate would follow; at least two hours would be pleasantly
occupied. Instead of <span class="smcap">Squire</span>, <span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span> rose. &quot;Well,&quot;
said <span class="smcap">Blameless</span>, throwing himself into attitude of attention,
&quot;let&#39;s hear what he has to say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Turned out to be exceedingly little. &quot;Government scale has been
attacked and defended many times,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span>. &quot;I
do not think it necessary to defend it again; but,&quot; here he leaned
on the table with engaging look at the now <span class="smcap">Breathless Bartley</span>,
&quot;the hon. gentleman can take a division if he thinks fit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Bartley</span> sat and audibly gasped. <span class="smcap">Jokim</span> gallantly
protested against this treatment of his hon.
friend; threatened to move adjournment of debate.
<span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span> sent for; arrived almost as breathless
as <span class="smcap">Bartley</span>; thunder boomed, lightning
flashed round head of <span class="smcap">Attorney-General</span>, who is
always finding himself astonished. &quot;The hon.
and learned gentleman,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span>,
with delightful assumption of anger, &quot;has abused
the situation. The Opposition have no means of
compelling him to talk sense, but talk he must.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span>, who had fled before prospect
of long speech from <span class="smcap">Bartley</span>, hastily brought
back. Don&#39;t know where incident would have
ended had it not been for <span class="smcap">Kenyon-Slaney</span>. Finding
opening he slipped in. Threw himself into
easy oratorical attitude; proposed to consider principle
of graduation adopted in Bill. Would do so
under three heads: injustice to the poor, injustice
to the middle-class, injustice to the rich.</p>

<p class="indent">This too much even for Opposition. With
groans of despair they rushed into Division Lobby;
<span class="smcap">Bartley&#39;s</span> scheme negatived by majority of 62.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget Bill passed Report
stage.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. John Brodrick</span> sitting on
front Opposition Bench through Committee of
Supply on Army Estimates this afternoon, invested
neighbourhood with unwonted air of fashion.
Not that there is, as a rule, any lack of style on
part of Leaders of Opposition regarded as a body. Only something,
<i>je ne sais quoi</i>, about <span class="smcap">Brodrick</span> that suggested profoundest depths
of <span class="smcap">Poole</span>. Couldn&#39;t help complimenting him on his turn out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Evidently you spare no expense,&quot; I said; &quot;though why even a
millionaire should wear an overcoat a day like this seems wicked
waste of property. Hope you are not growing desperate in anticipation
of Death Duties; spending your money recklessly so that <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>
may be disappointed when, for taxing purposes, he comes to
aggregate your property?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear boy,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Brodrick</span>, giving the overcoat a dexterous
lift by the lappels that added fresh grace to its fit at the back of the
neck, &quot;you&#39;re out of it altogether. This is the thirteen-and-sixpenny
coat supplied to Tommy Atkins in which,&mdash;following the
advice of Dr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>, wasn&#39;t it?&mdash;I, as I told the House the other
day, took a walk down Bond Street. The surtout underneath, which
I will fully display when the House gets a little fuller, cost seventeen-and-six
net. You will observe it is so made that you can
button it across and so save a waistcoat. If you must have a waistcoat,
we can do it at eight-and-ninepence. As for trousers, these
cost me thirteen shillings.&quot; (Here he stretched out and fondly
regarded a manly leg.) &quot;If I had taken a couple of pair, cut at the
same time you know, I could have had the two for 25<i>s.</i> I see your
eyes fixed on the boots. As you say, the shape of the foot may have
something to do with it. But apart from that, the article is equal to
what you pay thirty-five shillings for in Regent Street or Piccadilly.
Eleven-and-ninepence was the figure. Misfits, very popular with
privates newly joined, knock off the odd ninepence. Of course I
don&#39;t wear this suit every day. Can&#39;t afford that; put &#39;em on
whenever House in Committee on Army Supply or debate going forward
on Army matters. It encourages <span class="smcap">Cawmell&mdash;Bannerman</span>,
you know; helps <span class="smcap">Woodall</span> in getting his clothing vote; and, I
believe, is rather liked by Tommy Atkins.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Squire of Malwood</span> announces programme for
remainder of Session. A mere nothing. Only, as <span class="smcap">Prince Arthur</span>
says, in view of number of Bills and their contentious character, more
like what we are accustomed to at beginning of Session, than to have
dumped down in what should be its last month.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;&quot;<span class="smcap">Joseph</span>,&quot; said the Member for <span class="smcap">Sark</span>, dropping into
one of his tiresome didactic moods, &quot;would do well in any circumstances.
Whether in Upper Egypt or Lower, he was sure to come to
the top of the well, however securely his brethren might have packed
him in its lowest depths. But, regarding him just now as he criticised
the <span class="smcap">Squire&#39;s</span> arrangements for the Session, I could not help
thinking what a loss the auction-room has only partially survived
by his turn into the field of politics. If in early life, or even
middle age, he had only taken to the rostrum, the shade of the much
over-rated <span class="smcap">Robins</span> would have been dimmed in glory. Observe how
well he looks the part. See with what unconscious effect he produces
a stumpy piece of lead pencil, and looks round for bids. Listen to
the clear sharp notes of his voice. &#39;What shall we say, gentlemen,
for the Equalisation of Rates Bill? How many days will you give
for it? Name your own time, gentlemen. There is no reserve. Shall
we say six days? Does the tall, somewhat stout gentleman with a
white waistcoat, on the Treasury Bench, shake his head? Very well,
we will say four days. Going at four days;&#39; and the pencil,
scratching out six, substitutes four. This may seem very easy
when it&#39;s done; but it&#39;s art, <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, even genius.
If you think it&#39;s easy for a man discussing State
business, suddenly but completely to invest the
high court of Parliament with the tone and atmosphere
of an auction-room, just reckon up how
many other men of first rank in public life could
do it. Not to go further afield, could <span class="smcap">Prince
Arthur</span> manage it, even after a week&#39;s training?
Very well; then don&#39;t minimise a successful effort
because, thanks to the commanding influence of
native talent, its accomplishment seems easy to a
particular person.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Hicks-Beach</span>,
complaining that Ministers have dropped
a large number of Bills for lack of time to pass
them, and asserting that the time remaining at
their disposal for passing the poor balance is too
short, reduces it by three hours, in order that he
and his friends may lament the fact.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;House heard with keen satisfaction
that <span class="smcap">Szlumper</span> is around again. Not having seen
in the newspapers any telegrams from him lately,
there was vague idea that he had succumbed to
his exertions on occasion of the happy event at
White Lodge. Perhaps he was a little fatigued, for
<span class="smcap">Szlumper</span>, in addition to being Mayor of Richmond,
is almost human. No man born of woman
could with impunity fire off such a succession of
telegrams as on that memorable day <span class="smcap">Szlumper</span>
dealt out to his Sovereign, the Heir Apparent to
the Throne, the Crowned Heads of Europe, and
his ducal neighbours at the White Lodge. But on Royal Christening
day <span class="smcap">Szlumper</span> was around again, with a little <span class="smcap">Szlumper</span> carrying
a bouquet of flowers to be presented to the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>, whilst <span class="smcap">Szlumper</span>
<i>père</i>, plumped on his knees, welcomed his Sovereign within the gateway
of ancient Richmond.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Ah, ce</i> <span class="smcap">Szlumper</span>!&quot; said <span class="smcap">Sark</span>, &quot;he delights me more and more.
He represents, if you think of it, the essence of our English social
life. He is part of the foundation of the British Constitution, which
everyone, especially those regarding it from a distance, regards as the
perfection of good government.&quot;</p>
